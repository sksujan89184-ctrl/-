Myra — avatar generation prompt

Use this prompt with your preferred image model (Stable Diffusion, SDXL, Midjourney, etc.). Aim for PNG with alpha and 1024x1024 or 2048x2048.

Prompt:
"A beautiful and cute 2D anime-style virtual assistant girl named Myra, long flowing orange-brown hair, expressive blue eyes, stylish futuristic casual outfit in white and pink theme, friendly posture, warm smile, clean lines, cel-shaded anime aesthetic, high-detail face and hair, soft rim lighting, subtle specular highlights on clothing, studio lighting, 4k detail, crisp lineart, vibrant but balanced colors, polished composition, slight dynamic pose, transparent background"

Negative prompt:
"blurry, lowres, bad anatomy, extra limbs, deformed, mutated, watermark, signature, text, oversaturated, noisy, jpeg artifacts, nsfw"

Save output as `app/src/main/assets/myra.png` (PNG with alpha) or place in `res/drawable/` as `myra.png`.

If your tool cannot produce alpha, generate on plain white and remove background using any image editor or automatic background removal tool.
